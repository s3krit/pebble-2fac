pebble-2fac
===========

Google 2-factor implementation for Pebble.

What is it?
-----------

It's an implementation of [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) designed to be used for Google's 2-factor login system.
When complete, it will run entirely in C on the Pebble (rather than, for example, executing in JS on the phone and then sending data back to the Pebble). This will allow you to authenticate whether your phone is in range or not.

It's also a reason/fairly simple project for me to learn writing software for the Pebble.

How do I use it?
----------------

You don't. Yet. Well, I mean, go ahead and check out the code and try get it working on your end. But it's really not ready yet.
